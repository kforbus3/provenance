# Changelog

Notable changes to Fleet Terminal, newest first. Dates are release dates. Database
schema migrations apply automatically on startup; deploy notes call out anything else.

## v0.8.2 — Fixes: in-app help and CVE database

Two defect fixes for the in-app documentation and the vulnerability scanner.

- **In-app Help no longer renders blank.** The searchable help bundle is generated
  from the documentation at image-build time; the frontend image now builds with the
  docs present in its context, so Help shows its guides instead of a blank page. The
  build now fails fast if the help content is missing rather than shipping it empty,
  and the Help page degrades to a clear message if a bundle is ever absent.
- **CVE database update/import fixed.** The scanner could not create its database
  directory when running as its unprivileged user, so both the online update and the
  offline import failed with a permission error. The scanner image now creates that
  directory with the correct ownership, and the update error in the UI now shows the
  scanner's actual message instead of assuming a connectivity problem.

*Deploy:* rebuild the frontend and scanner images. If the CVE database volume already
exists from a prior deploy, correct its ownership once —
`docker compose exec -u root grype-scanner chown -R 10001:10001 /home/scanner/.cache/grype`
(or remove and recreate the `grype-db` volume) — then update the database from the
Vulnerabilities page.

## v0.8.0 — Vulnerability scanning

CVE vulnerability scanning of managed hosts, distinct from the OpenSCAP compliance
scans.

- **Vulnerability scanning (Grype).** Scan a host or a whole group for known-
  vulnerable packages and get per-host findings with **CVSS scores** (CVE, package,
  installed vs. fixed version, severity, score). A new `grype-scanner` sidecar does
  the matching centrally; the backend reads each host's package database over SSH, so
  **nothing is installed on managed hosts**. CVSS is populated even on Debian/Ubuntu
  (enriched from the associated NVD records).
- **Vulnerabilities page** with a fleet roll-up (highest CVSS and severity counts per
  host) and a drill-in findings table. Scans run on demand or on a schedule, findings
  are alertable and exportable to CSV, and results are audited.
- **CVE database management** — **Update online** when the backend has internet, or
  **Import offline** a pre-downloaded database archive for air-gapped deployments. The
  database build date is shown.

*Deploy:* adds the `grype-scanner` container (rebuild the stack) and migration `0026`.
Load the CVE database once from the Vulnerabilities page before the first scan.

## v0.7.0 — Enterprise integration

Seven capabilities that close common enterprise/PAM gaps.

- **Service accounts & API tokens.** Non-human identities for automation (CI/CD, IaC,
  monitoring) that carry roles and host access like a user but authenticate via hashed,
  optionally-expiring `flt_` bearer tokens — and survive employee turnover. Managed on a
  new Service Accounts page.
- **Compliance reporting.** Export access, audit, certificate, and scan-posture
  evidence as CSV over any date range from a new Reports page, and schedule recurring
  reports delivered as CSV email attachments.
- **Live session shadowing.** Watch an active terminal session in real time, read-only,
  for four-eyes oversight; watching is itself audited.
- **MFA recovery codes.** One-time backup codes as a fallback for a lost authenticator
  or passkey, generated self-service in Security settings.
- **Broader alerting.** Native PagerDuty and Opsgenie incident channels (severity-gated)
  and a Microsoft Teams webhook format, alongside email and generic webhooks.
- **Dynamic host groups.** Group membership can follow a rule over host attributes
  (environment, tags, OS, hostname); matching hosts join automatically.

*Deploy:* migrations `0022`–`0025`.

## v0.6.2 — Correct version stamping

- The deployed build now reports its real release version (from git tags) instead of
  `dev`, and the release tooling keeps version tags in sync across mirrors.

## v0.6.1 — Host-flapping fix

- Fixed hosts intermittently showing offline after v0.6.0: the health-check sweep was
  parallelized too aggressively for the jump host's SSH limits. Sweep concurrency is now
  bounded (configurable via `FLEET_MONITOR_CONCURRENCY`, default 6).

## v0.6.0 — Hardening and a deeper Ask AI

A security/reliability hardening pass plus a much-expanded AI assistant.

- **Ask AI upgraded** from a single-shot question box into a fleet-health assistant:
  multi-turn conversation memory (follow-up questions), a **fleet-insights** engine
  (offline hosts, low disk, capacity/disk-runway projection, high load, pending
  updates) surfaced on the dashboard and to the assistant, and opt-in **scheduled
  fleet-health digests**.
- **Reliability & security fixes:** a browser-terminal crash/DoS race, an OIDC
  account-binding weakness, silent 1000-host caps in monitoring and certificate-
  revocation distribution, configurable data/audit **retention**, atomic scheduler
  claims, bounded scan/playbook output, backup and audit-forwarding hardening, and an
  atomic first-run bootstrap.

*Deploy:* migration `0021` (host metric history); new optional retention/monitor
settings.
