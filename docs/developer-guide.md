# Fleet Terminal — Developer Guide

This guide covers building, running, and extending Fleet Terminal. Everything
runs through Docker, so **no local Go, Node, or PostgreSQL toolchain is required.**

docs/                   this documentation
Makefile                developer entrypoints
```

The SSO integrations pull in a few third-party libraries (run `make tidy` after
changing them): `github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3` and `golang.org/x/oauth2` for the
OIDC authorization-code/PKCE flow, and `github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3` for LDAP/AD
sign-in.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose.
- That's it. The Makefile shells into throwaway `golang:1.23-alpine` and
  `node:22-alpine` containers for builds and tests.

## Quick start

```sh
make env      # create .env from .env.example if missing
make up       # build & start the full stack + test fabric
make ps       # show running services
make logs     # tail logs
```

`make up` brings up PostgreSQL, Redis, the backend, the frontend, the
**`ansible-runner`** sidecar (Python/Ansible service the `playbook` module calls
to lint and run playbooks — built from `deploy/ansible-runner`), and the local
**test fabric** (jump host + managed hosts used for end-to-end SSH testing).
Use `make up-app` to start only the application stack without the test fabric.

Once the stack is healthy, open the frontend (default `http://localhost:8080`)
and complete the **bootstrap** flow (see [Admin Guide](./admin-guide.md)).

## Common Makefile targets

| Target | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `make help` | List all targets |
| `make env` | Create `.env` from `.env.example` if missing |
| `make up` | Build & start full stack + test fabric |
| `make up-app` | Start only the application stack |
| `make down` | Stop the stack |
| `make clean` | Stop and remove volumes (**destroys data**) |
| `make logs` / `make ps` | Tail logs / show services |
| `make build` | Build all images |
| `make backend-build` | Compile the backend in a throwaway Go container |
| `make test` | Run all tests (`backend-test` + `frontend-test`) |
| `make backend-test` | Go unit + integration tests |
| `make frontend-test` | Frontend unit tests |
| `make lint` | `go vet` |
| `make tidy` | `go mod tidy` |

## Building & testing the backend

```sh
make backend-build      # compile everything
make backend-test       # go test ./...
make test               # backend + frontend
```

To compile a single package directly (the pattern used in CI for module workers):

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/backend:/src" -w /src golang:1.23-alpine \
  sh -c "apk add --no-cache git >/dev/null 2>&1 && GOFLAGS=-mod=mod go build ./internal/hosts/..."
```

## Configuration

All configuration is environment-driven (`backend/internal/config/config.go`),
so the same binary runs identically across Docker, Kubernetes, and systemd. Key
variables (see `.env.example` and the [Admin Guide](./admin-guide.md) for the
full list):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `FLEET_ENV` | `development` | `development` relaxes secret validation |
| `FLEET_HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | listen address |
| `FLEET_PUBLIC_URL` | `https://localhost:8443` | external base URL (cookies/CORS) |
| `FLEET_DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://fleet:fleet@postgres:5432/fleet?sslmode=disable` | DB DSN |
| `FLEET_MIGRATE_ON_START` | `true` | run migrations at boot |
| `FLEET_JWT_SECRET` | — | HMAC secret for access tokens (≥32 bytes in prod) |
| `FLEET_CSRF_SECRET` | — | CSRF secret (≥16 bytes in prod) |
| `FLEET_CA_PASSPHRASE` | — | encrypts the CA private key (≥16 bytes in prod) |
| `FLEET_COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` | set `false` only for non-HTTPS local dev |
| `FLEET_JUMP_HOST` / `FLEET_JUMP_USER` | `jumphost:22` / `fleet` | SSH egress |
| `FLEET_USER_CERT_TTL` | `168h` (7d) | ephemeral user cert lifetime |
| `FLEET_CERT_RENEW_BEFORE` | `24h` | renew certs this far ahead of expiry |
| `FLEET_RECORDING_DIR` | `/var/lib/fleet/recordings` | session recordings |

In `development`, missing secrets fall back to **insecure deterministic
defaults** so the stack boots — never run that way in production. In
`production`, startup fails if `FLEET_JWT_SECRET`, `FLEET_CSRF_SECRET`, or
`FLEET_CA_PASSPHRASE` are missing/too short.

## Adding a backend HTTP module

Modules follow the canonical shape in `internal/hosts/handlers.go`:

1. Create `internal/<pkg>/<pkg>.go`. Expose:
   ```go
   func Mount(r chi.Router, d *app.Deps) { … }
   ```
2. Construct your handler from `*app.Deps` only (`d.Store`, `d.Cfg`, `d.Log`,
   `d.Auth`, and the SSH services `d.CA` / `d.Gateway`). This avoids import cycles.
3. Gate **every** route:
   ```go
   r.Group(func(pr chi.Router) {
       pr.Use(d.Auth.RequireAuth)
       pr.With(d.Auth.RequirePermission("Host.View")).Get("/things", h.list)
   })
   ```
4. Get the caller with `auth.MustPrincipal(r)`.
5. Use **only parameterized SQL** via the store. If you need a new query, add a
   method to the matching `internal/store/*.go` file.
6. Use the shared **`internal/httpx`** helpers rather than per-package copies for
   responses, decoding, and IDs — `httpx.WriteJSON` / `httpx.WriteError`,
   `httpx.Decode(w, r, &req)`, and `httpx.ParseID(w, r)` for the `{id}` URL param.
7. Audit every state change. Newer handlers call `httpx.Audit`, which wraps the
   best-effort append:
   ```go
   httpx.Audit(r, d.Store, models.AuditEvent{
       ActorID: &p.UserID, ActorName: p.Username, Action: "thing.create",
       TargetKind: "thing", TargetID: id.String(), Detail: map[string]any{…},
   })
   ```
8. Mount it from the router seam in `internal/api/server.go`
   (`registerRoutes` / `mountModules`), e.g. `mything.Mount(r, deps)`.

Match the existing code style exactly: package doc comment, the shared
`internal/httpx` helpers (not per-package `writeJSON` / `writeError` copies),
request structs with `json:"…"` tags, and best-effort audit/event writes via
`httpx.Audit`.

## Frontend

The SPA lives in `frontend/src` (React + Vite, Zustand stores, an `api/` client
layer mirroring the REST modules). `VITE_API_BASE` points the client at the
backend. Run `make frontend-test` for unit tests.

## Releasing

CI builds the backend and frontend images. Configuration is environment-driven,
so promotion between environments is a matter of swapping env values and secrets;
see [deploy/k8s](../deploy/k8s) for Kubernetes manifests and the
[Disaster Recovery guide](./disaster-recovery.md) for backup/restore.

## Mirroring to a second remote

The public remote and a private mirror can carry equivalent content under
different commit identities (the public history is scrubbed of personal emails,
so the two histories are disjoint and won't fast-forward into each other).
`scripts/mirror-to-gitlab.sh` replays new commits from the current branch onto
the mirror's tip, re-authored with your mirror identity, and fast-forward-pushes
(no force-push; the mirror's history is preserved). Configure it once with the
`fleet.gitlab*` git-config keys documented in the script header, then run it
after pushing to the public remote. It is idempotent — with nothing new to
replay, it does nothing.
